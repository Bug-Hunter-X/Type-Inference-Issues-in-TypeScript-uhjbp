# Type Inference Issues in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with type inference in TypeScript.  The problem revolves around unexpected behavior when combining arrays of numbers using the `concat` method.  The type system may not accurately infer the resulting array's type, leading to potential runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

## Problem Description

The `combine` function appears straightforward: it concatenates two number arrays. However, under certain scenarios, TypeScript's type inference might not correctly deduce that the result is still a `number[]`.  This can lead to situations where you might encounter runtime errors or unexpected type issues if you try to use the resulting array in a way that relies on its precise type.

## Solution

Explicitly defining the return type of the function eliminates ambiguity. By specifying that the `combine` function returns `number[]`, we explicitly tell TypeScript the exact type of the result, preventing any type-related inference issues.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory.
3. Compile and run the TypeScript code: `tsc bug.ts && node bug.js`  (You'll likely see the issue in the original `bug.ts`).
4. Compile and run the corrected TypeScript code: `tsc bugSolution.ts && node bugSolution.js` (This demonstrates the fix).

This example highlights the importance of careful type definition, especially when working with more complex TypeScript features.
